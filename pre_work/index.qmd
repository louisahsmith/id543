# Install R and RStudio

1. Download R from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Choose the link at the top that corresponds to your operating system. [If you have a Mac, make sure you [choose correctly](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814) between the Apple Silicon (M1/M2) and Intel options.]{.aside} Unless you downloaded R within the past month or two, do so again -- you want the most up-to-date version (â‰¥ R 4.3) for this class.

2. Download [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (step 2 on that page -- you already completed step 1 above!). It should automatically recognize your operating system, but if not, choose the correct link at the bottom.[Which version of RStudio you have is not as important, but it's nice to stay up-to-date for the newest features!]{.aside}

# Readings

1. [Sections 1.4-1.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro.html#prerequisites) of *R for Data Science*. Run the code in your RStudio console as you go.[In particular, make sure you install the packages in the text.]{.aside}

2. [Chapter 3](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics.html) of *R for Data Science*. Again, run the code in your RStudio console as you read. Try the exercises.[If you're wondering what happened to chapter 2, we'll be doing that one together!]{.aside}

3. Optional, but helpful: [Chapter 2](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html) of *Hands-On Programming with R*. For the purposes of this class, we will necessarily skip some of the R basics to focus on the skills you'll need most. This is a good resource if you want to learn more about them, so it's highly recommended, you just don't need to master it as part of your pre-work.
