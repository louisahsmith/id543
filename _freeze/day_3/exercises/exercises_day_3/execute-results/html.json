Investigate it a bit -- look at the variables, etc. (I have no idea what any of these datasets are!). Save it as an `.rds` file and/or a `.csv` file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Exercises 2\n\nCreate an R project! \n\nCopy and paste <https://github.com/louisahsmith/id543/raw/main/data/nlsy.rds> into your browser to download the data as an `.rds` file. Create a `data/` directory in your R project and move it there. Move this `.qmd` folder into your R project as well. Now this code should read in the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnlsy <- readr::read_rds(here::here(\"data\", \"nlsy.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nMove the dataset you created in the previous exercise into the `data/` directory as well. Write code to read it in:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nCreate a plot -- of anything! -- using the dataset you downloaded. Save it as a `.png` file using `ggsave()` to a `figures/` directory that you create.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Exercises 3\n\nRead in the `nlsy` dataset if it's not already in your environment. Replace the sleep variables with `NA` if they are 12 or greater. Create a dataset with `id`, the sleep variables, and the income variables, and restrict it to complete cases. Save that dataset as a csv file in your `code/` directory.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Exercises 4\n\nRead in the kids dataset. You'll have to fill in the rest of the code for reading in the `.csv` file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkids_cols <- c(\"id_kid\", \"id_mom\", \"sex_kid\", \"dob_kid\",\"agebir_mom\", \"bwt_kid\")\n\nnlsy_kids <- read_csv(\"https://github.com/louisahsmith/id543/raw/main/data/nlsy-child.csv\", \n                      ...)\n```\n:::\n\n\nCreate the smaller version of the dataset we were using:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnlsy_sleep <- read_rds(\"https://github.com/louisahsmith/id543/raw/main/data/nlsy.rds\") |> \n  select(id, contains(\"sleep\"), age_bir, sex)\n```\n:::\n\n\nPractice the joins we did: left, right, full, and inner. Look at the differences in the data that results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhen we wanted to join on the mom's first birth, we used `join_by(id == id_mom, age_bir == agebir_mom)`. Read the documentation for `join_by()` to help you create a dataset that has only the kids from the mom's *later* births.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Exercises 5\n\nWithin the `nlsy_kids` dataset, calculate summary statistics for the kids:\n\n- the minimum and maximum year of birth\n- the mean birthweight in grams (you will have to convert first!)\n- bonus: the proportion of kids who were less than 2500g at birth (hint: what is the mean of a binary variable? You will need to create that binary variable)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Exercises 6\n\nDo the same as above, but separately for male and female children. First, however, turn the `sex_kid` variable into a factor variable with \"male\" = 1, \"female\" = 2.",
