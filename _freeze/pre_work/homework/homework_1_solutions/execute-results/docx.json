Install R and RStudio as well as the packages described in Section 1.4 of of R for Data Science. Paste the code you used to install those packages below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"arrow\", \"babynames\", \"curl\", \"duckdb\", \"gapminder\", \"ggrepel\", \"ggridges\", \"ggthemes\", \"hexbin\", \"janitor\", \"Lahman\", \"leaflet\", \"maps\", \"nycflights13\", \"openxlsx\", \"palmerpenguins\", \"repurrrsive\", \"tidymodels\", \"writexl\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.\tCreate a vector named `temp` with the average low temperatures in December for London, Shanghai, Sydney, Boston, Mexico City and Johannesburg which are 40, 38, 64, 28, 42 and 57Â° Fahrenheit. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n3.\tCreate a second vector with the city names called `city`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n4.\tUse the `setNames()` function to assign the city names to the corresponding temperatures using the two objects create above. (Hint: `help(setNames)`). You should overwrite your original `temp` vector with the named vector. Print the `temp` vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n5.\tRecall that you can use the `[]` operator directly following a vector name to select specific values contained within that vector (e.g. `temp[1]` should return `40`). Use this `[]` operator and the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the temperatures for Sydney, Mexico City and Johannesburg.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n6.\tCreate a vector of all positive even numbers smaller than 75 using the `seq()` function. (Hint: `help(seq)`)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n7.\tCreate a vector of numbers. Let the first value of the vector be 4, with a maximum value < 80, adding numbers in increments of 2/3. How many elements are in this vector?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\ng.  Using your answer to the previous question, find another solution to create the same vector as the previous question.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
