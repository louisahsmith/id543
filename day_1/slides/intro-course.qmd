## Packages {.smaller}

-   Some functions are built into R
    -   `mean()`, `lm()`, `table()`, etc.
-   They actually come from built-in packages
    -   `base`, `stats`, `graphics`, etc.
-   Anyone (yes, *anyone*) build their own package to add to the functionality of R
    -   `{ggplot2}`, `{dplyr}`, `{data.table}`, `{survival}`, etc. ![](../../img/stickers.png)[^1]

## Packages {.r-fit-text}

-   You have to **install** a package once[^2]

[^2]: Actually, with every new major R release, but we won't worry about that.

``` r
install.packages("survival")
```

-   You then have to **load** the package every time you want to use it

``` r
library(survival)
```

## Packages

"You only have to buy the book once, but you have to go get it out of the bookshelf every time you want to read it."

``` r
install.packages("survival")
library(survival)
survfit(...)
```

## Package details {.smaller}

-   When you use `install.packages`, packages are downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)
    -   This is also where you downloaded R
-   Packages can be hosted lots of other places, such as [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) (for bioinformatics), and [Github](https://www.github.com) (for personal projects or while still developing)
-   The folks at CRAN check to make things "work" in some sense, but don't check on the statistical methods...
    -   But because R is open-source, you can always read the code yourself
-   Two functions from different packages can have the same name... if you load them both, you may have some trouble

## tidyverse

-   The same people who make RStudio also are responsible for a set of packages called the `tidyverse`

![](../../img/tidy-data.png){fig-align="center"}

## tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
-   `install.packages(tidyverse)` actually downloads more than a dozen packages[^3]
-   `library(tidyverse)` loads:

::: {.center .smaller}
`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`, `lubridate`
:::

This is by no means the only way to manage your data, but I find that a lot of the time, it's the easiest and simplest way to get things done.

# Demo

# Using R

## The biggest difference between R and Stata is that R can have many different objects in its environment

- datasets, numbers, figures, etc.
- you have to be explicit about storing and retrieving objects
  - e.g., what dataset a variable belongs to

## R uses `<-` to store objects in the environment

I call this the "assignment arrow"

```{r}
# create values
vals <- c(1, 645, 329)
```

Now `vals` holds those values

::: callout-warning
No assignment arrow means that the object will be printed to the console (and lost forever!)
:::

## Objects

We can retrieve those values by running just the name of the object

```{r}
vals
```

We can also perform operations on them

```{r}
mean(vals)
```

If we want to keep the result of that operation, we need to use `<-` again

```{r}
mean_val <- mean(vals)
```


## Types of data (*classes*)

We could also create a character *vector*:

```{r}
chars <- c("dog", "cat", "rhino")
chars
```

Or a *logical* vector:

```{r}
logs <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
logs
```

::: callout-tip
We'll see more options as we go along!
:::

## Types of objects

We created *vectors* with the `c()` function (`c` stands for concatenate)

We could also create a *matrix* of values with the `matrix()` function:

```{r}
# turn the vector of numbers into a 2-row matrix
mat <- matrix(c(234, 7456, 12, 654, 183, 753), nrow = 2)
mat
```

## Indices

The numbers in square brackets are *indices*, which we can use to pull out values:

```{r}
# extract second row
mat[2, ]
```

```{r}
# extract first column
mat[, 1]
```

# Demo

# Dataframes

## Dataframes

- We usually do analysis in R with dataframes (or some variant)
- Dataframes basically work like spreadsheets: here, columns are variables, and rows are observations
- Here's some data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dat
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
head(dat, n = 20)
```

## Indices in dataframes

We can also pull out data from dataframes using "square bracket notation":

```{r}
dat[3, ]
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
dat[, 3]
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
dat[1:100, 3]
```

## Dollar sign notation

It's much more useful to be able to pull out a variable by its name, though:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dat$sex_cat
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
dat$sex_cat[1:200]
```

## Variables as strings

We can also pull out one or more variables by quoting their names in square brackets:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dat[, "sex_cat"]
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
dat[, "sex_cat"][1:200]
```

## Variables

- Variables can also be different types, including numeric, character, logical, and factor.
- You can check what type of variable you're dealing with: `class(dat$sex_cat)` (factor!)
- A special type of dataframe called a "tibble" will show you at the top:

```{r}
nlsy
```

##

## tibbles are basically just pretty dataframes

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| comment: "" 
as_tibble(nlsy)[, 1:4]
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| comment: ""
as.data.frame(nlsy)[, 1:4]
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| comment: ""
as.data.frame(nlsy)[1:20, 1:4]
```
:::
::::

## You can make your own tibble!

We'll be using existing data, but you might want to create a mini-dataset to test on:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
dat1 <- tibble(
  age = c(24, 76, 38),
  height_in = c(70, 64, 68),
  height_cm = height_in * 2.54
)
dat1
```

:::
  
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
dat2 <- tribble(
  ~n, ~food, ~animal,
  39, "banana", "monkey",
  21, "milk", "cat",
  18, "bone", "dog"
)
dat2
```

## Different ways to do the same thing

There are usually multiple ways to achieve a task in R. Ideally we'd like solutions that are:

- **readable**: If you share your code with someone, can they figure out what you're doing?
- **reliable**: Is this way always going to work, even if the data is slightly different?
- **safe**: Is this way going to introduce errors into your code without you noticing?
- **fast**: Is this an efficient way to do things, given all of the above?

We'll focus on the *tidyverse* because I think it's the optimal mix of those characteristics
