1. Using the NLSY data, make a scatter plot of the relationship between hours of sleep on weekends and weekdays. Color it according to region (where 1 = northeast, 2 = north central, 3 = south, and 4 = west).

2. Replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()`. What does this do? Why might this be a good choice for this graph? Play with the `width = ` and `height = ` options. This site may help: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html

3. Use the `shape = ` argument to map the sex variable to different shapes. Change the shapes to squares and diamonds. (Hint: how did we manually change colors to certain values? This might help: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html)

4. When we're comparing distributions with very different numbers of observations, instead of scaling the y-axis like we did with the `facet_grid()` function, we might want to make density histograms. Use google to figure out how to make a density histogram of income. Facet it by region.

5. Make each of the regions in your histogram from part 1 a different color. (Hint: compare what `col = ` and `fill = ` do to histograms).

6. Instead of a log-transformed x-axis, make a square-root transformed x-axis.

7. Doing part 3 squishes the labels on the x-axis. Using the `breaks = ` argument that all the `scale_x_()` functions have, make labels at 1000, 10000, 25000, and 50000.

8. The order of the different levels of a factor variable is important. Describe a scenario where different orders of the levels of a factor variable may lead to different results. (Hint: Think about how factor variables are treated a regression analysis.)
Comment SF: This may be too advanced. But if the students already know how to run regression analysis in STATA, they might know this. In STATA, the same as in R the lowest/first level is  used as reference level for categorical variables in a regression model as default.

9. The "race_eth"-variable in the NLSY dataset relates to the following level: hispanic (1), black (2), other (3). When loading the data it is a numeric variable. Turn it into a factor variable making sure it is labeled correctly. 

10. Create a new variable called "race_reor", reordering the levels such that "other" would automatically be used as reference level in analyses. Use the count()-function to check the order of these two variables.

11. Age of individuals contained in the NLSY dataset ranges from 13 to 52 years (variable: age_bir). Use case_when() to create the following age categories: teenager (13-19), young adult (20-29), adult (30-52). Make sure it is a correctly labeled factor variable (hint: this can be a two step process).

12. Using the age group factor variable, show the mean age and total number of individuals in each age group.
