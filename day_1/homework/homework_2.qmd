1. Using the NLSY data, make a scatter plot of the relationship between hours of sleep on weekends and weekdays. Color it according to region (where 1 = northeast, 2 = north central, 3 = south, and 4 = west).

2. Replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()`. What does this do? Why might this be a good choice for this graph? Play with the `width = ` and `height = ` options. This site may help: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html

3. Use the `shape = ` argument to map the sex variable to different shapes. Change the shapes to squares and diamonds. (Hint: how did we manually change colors to certain values? This might help: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html)

1. When we're comparing distributions with very different numbers of observations, instead of scaling the y-axis like we did with the `facet_grid()` function, we might want to make density histograms. Use google to figure out how to make a density histogram of income. Facet it by region.

2. Make each of the regions in your histogram from part 1 a different color. (Hint: compare what `col = ` and `fill = ` do to histograms).

3. Instead of a log-transformed x-axis, make a square-root transformed x-axis.

4. Doing part 3 squishes the labels on the x-axis. Using the `breaks = ` argument that all the `scale_x_()` functions have, make labels at 1000, 10000, 25000, and 50000.
