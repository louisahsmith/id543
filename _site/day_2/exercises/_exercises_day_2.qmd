# Install quarto

1.  Download quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

2.  Render this document using the button at the top of the document.

3.  Switch back and forth between Visual and Source mode.

4. Change `execute: eval:` to `true` at the top of the document. Try to render it.

5. Add `format: docx` to the top of the document and render.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
nlsy <- read_rds("https://github.com/louisahsmith/id543/raw/main/data/nlsy.rds")
```

# Exercises 1: Making new variables with `mutate()`

## Standardized income

Using the NLSY data and `mutate()`, make a standardized (centered at the mean, and divided by the standard deviation) version of income. Look at this variable using `summary()`.

```{r}
# replace the ... with your code
nlsy <- mutate(nlsy, income_stand = ...)

summary(nlsy$income_stand)
```

## Standardized log(income)

Do the same thing, but using income on the log scale. Look at this variable using `summary()`. Can you figure out what happened? (Hint: look at your log(income) variable.)

```{r}

```

# Exercises 2: Selecting variables using `select()`

## Select centered variables

Create mean-centered versions of `age_bir`, `nsibs`, `income`, and the two sleep variables. Use the same ending (e.g., `cent`) for all of them. Then make a new dataset of just the centered variables using `select()` and a helper.

```{r}
nlsy <- mutate(nlsy,
               age_bir_cent = ...,
               nsibs_cent = ...,
               ...)
nlsy_new <- select(nlsy, ...)
```

## Selecting based on a vector

Create a dataset called `nlsy_orig` that contains only the raw variables, using a vector of names and the `all_of()` helper. I'll start you off with the variable names.

```{r}
colnames_orig <- c("glasses", "eyesight", "sleep_wkdy", "sleep_wknd",
                   "id", "nsibs", "samp", "race_eth", "sex", "region", 
                   "income", "res_1980", "res_2002", "age_bir")
```

## Selecting another way

Can you come up with another way to end up with the same raw variables? (Hint: what do the added variables have in common?)

```{r}

```

# Exercises 3: Subset your data with `filter()`

### "Or" conditions

Create a dataset with all the observations that get over 7 hours of sleep on both weekends and weekdays *or* who have an income greater than/equal to 20,000 and less than/equal to 50,000.

```{r}
nlsy_or <- filter(nlsy, ...)
```

### Missing values

Create a dataset that consists *only* of the missing values in `slp_cat_wkdy`. Check how many rows it has (there should be 3!).

```{r}

```

## `case_when()`

Try again to make a new variable for standardized log-income. This time, if you are not able to calculate log(income) for an observation, replace it with a missing value (using `case_when()`). This time, when you standardize log(income), you'll have to use `na.rm = TRUE` to remove missing values both when you take the mean and the standard deviation.

```{r}
nlsy <- mutate(nlsy,
               log_income_stand = case_when(
                 ...
               ))
```

# Exercises 4: Pipes

Translate this code into a piped version:

```{r}
nlsy2 <- mutate(nlsy, 
                slp_cat_wkdy = case_when(
                  sleep_wkdy < 5 ~ "little",
                  sleep_wkdy < 7 ~ "some",
                  sleep_wkdy < 9 ~ "ideal",
                  sleep_wkdy < 12 ~ "lots",
                  TRUE ~ NA_character_))
missing_sleep <- filter(nlsy2, is.na(slp_cat_wkdy))
missing_sleep <- select(missing_sleep, starts_with("slp"), contains("sleep"))
missing_sleep
```

```{r}
missing_sleep <- nlsy %>% ...
```

Can you rearrange this sequence of steps into a different order and get the same answer?

```{r}

```
